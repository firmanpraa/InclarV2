                        The plan is that INCLAR will be held regularly on an annual basis. However, the
                        Covid-19 pandemic that hit Indonesia in 2020, also impacted the implementation
                        of the second INCLAR. Thus, the second INCLAR is planned to be held in 2021. See
                        you at the second INCLAR!
