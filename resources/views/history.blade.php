                        It is planned that INCLAR will be held regularly every year. However, the
                        Covid-19 pandemic that hit Indonesia in 2020, also had an impact on the
                        implementation of the second INCLAR. Therefore, the second INCLAR is planned to
                        be held in 2021. See you at the second INCLAR!
